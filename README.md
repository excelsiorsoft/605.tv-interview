 Given a grid and a robot that starts from the top left corner of the grid, count the number of unique paths for the robot to reach bottom right corner of grid
 
 - Robot can only move down and to the right
 
 Example:
     
         -------
         |  |  |
         -------
         |  |  |
         -------
 
 In a 2x2 grid, you have two unique paths
 - Right, down
 - Down, right
        
             ----------
             |  |  |  |
             ----------
             |  |  |  |
             ----------
